This Python project demonstrates how to generate binary numbers from 1 to N using a queue data structure. It utilizes Python's `deque` for efficient queue operations and applies the **First In, First Out (FIFO)** principle.

## Features

- Generate binary numbers from 1 to N.
- Uses Python’s `deque` for efficient queue operations.
- Implements the [**FIFO** algorithm](https://techterms.com/definition/fifo).
